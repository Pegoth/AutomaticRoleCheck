# Automatic Role Check

Lightweight approach for automatically accepting role check pop-ups.

## Usage
- To see which version you are using: `/arc`.
- To enable the addon: `/arc enable`.
- To disable the addon: `/arc disable`.
- To disable the addon once (e.g. for the upcoming role check): `/arc disableonce`.

## Feedback
Please remember that I'm always working to improve the addon so I'm interested in hearing directly from you about anything you want to share or ask. You can report this using the issues on GitHub.
